There is a possible combination that sums to 0 =&gt; <code>-10 + 7 + 3 = 0</code>. <br>Therefore,  passing this array to our function should return <code>true</code>. </p><p>Another example: the array <code>[0]</code> has one number but there still is a possible combination that will result in 0 =&gt; <code>0 + 0 + 0</code>. The result is <code>true</code>.</p><p>Finally, the array <code>[1,4,2,-9]</code> doesn't have any combination of 3 numbers that sum to 0 and therefore should return <code>false</code>.</p><p>Go get em!</p>
